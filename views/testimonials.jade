        The thing I love most about AP study notes is that it's like the text book but with ctrl + f capabilities :P Why dig through that 10 page chapter because you forgot what the "Oneida Community" was?

        I am writing to express my gratitude to you for the exemplary content contained within your Psychology section.  You see, I was preparing for the Introductory Psychology CLEP test to lesson my burden of an eight-week course as being in the military, stationed overseas, my time is measured.  When I "Googled" psychological methods and found your site it allowed me to immerse myself in key points of psychology.  All of the chapter notes proved vital in me securing 3 semester hours with a score of 65 on the test when 50 would have allowed me to pass.  Keep up the great work.

        APstudynotes.com has helped me countless times with my AP US History exams. I'd like to think my success in the class is largely because of the great summaries, practice exams, and vocabulary lists of each chapter available. They have been great study tools. I can't recommend the site enough!

        the topics mentioned are well thought out and they present the most relevant information. As well as that, these notes are more concise and get to the point with no unnecessary background!
